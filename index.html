            <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Our campus was established in March 2004</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">ISL is located on protected woodland and housed in purpose-built facilities in its own
                grounds. The building was designed in the 1970s as a French middle school, with light and spacious rooms
                grouped in clusters around a central atrium.
                Primary and Secondary school each have their own area, but share the library and the art and music
                rooms. As well as taking place in the gym, many of our sports activities take place outdoors in a local
                stadium or in the state-of-the-art gym and swimming pool of the neighbouring districts. Our outdoor
                premises include a large upper playground, a multi-sport astro-turf playing field and a small
                amphitheatre.
                The building, which is rented from local city authorities (La Métropole), was designed in the 1970's as
                a French middle school (11-16 year olds) and includes light and spacious class and work rooms grouped in
                clusters over 6 half-floors. There are dedicated facilities for art and design, music and movement and
                ICT, a large, well-equipped library and a small gym for primary school P.E. and Enrichment Activities.
                Our outdoor premises include a primary playground, a new multi-sports astro-turf playing field, a small
                amphitheatre and attractive grassed areas. The older children have access to various municipal playing
                fields, an athletics stadium and a large state-of-the-art gymnasium nearby for their sports lessons. We
                are also usually able to offer swimming sessions to some of our younger primary students in a nearby
                municipal pool.</p>

                <p> Students from Grades 5-9 participated in ISL's annual Poetry Slam, in which they performed poetry
                    before judges and peers in order to select the top “performers” from each class.But the Poetry Slam
                    is much more than a competition. It is a week when students are encouraged to not only write poems,
                    but also to share their feelings, impressions and ideas through poetry. There are magical moments
                    during the Poetry Slam when the student-poet creates images and evokes
                    feelings in the audience. Somehow this comes about through a certain combination of words and
                    phrases and just as importantly, through the poet's sincere expression of those words. During this
                    week, windows into the hearts and souls of the students are opened, if only briefly. Ultimately, the
                    goals of the Poetry Slam are to demystify poetry, to distance it from a studied analysis of poetry
                    and to help students recognize and release the poet inside themselves.</p>

                <p> Almost every year there is a summer fete and students are invited to the school for about 1 hour but
                    due to covid-19 we are not able to do the summmer fete for the last almost 3 years. In
                    the sumer fete there is activities like you could get a free watch or win a netendo but these
                    actvities are prepared befour the summer fete and if you want to win all you need is a bit money
                    like 1 euro. The activity workes like this: You pay the amount that is needed and my put your name
                    in a box at the summer fete if your name is selcted you get to keep the price and you won.</p>
